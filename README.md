Project Description:

This project presents the development of an advanced movie search engine, which aims to provide movie enthusiasts and the general public with an efficient and user-friendly platform for searching and discovering movies. The search engine is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional search engines by implementing partial and composite queries to search relevant data in the cache management system. This functionality improves the search efficiency and reduces the need for API calls, which in turn increases scalability.

To achieve these objectives, the project utilized Redis as a local cache management system, which enabled the search engine to store frequently accessed data in a cache and retrieve it quickly when needed. The frontend of the search engine was developed using React JS, while Python was used for the backend.

The project has demonstrated skills in problem-solving, cache management, web development, and scalability. The implementation of partial and composite queries was a significant achievement, as it solved a complex computing problem and improved the search functionality. The use of Redis as a cache management system improved search efficiency and reduced the need for API calls, which increased scalability. The use of React JS and Python for the frontend and backend development, respectively, ensured the search engine's user-friendliness and reliability.

Overall, this project has succeeded in developing an advanced movie search engine that is efficient, user-friendly, and scalable. It is expected that this search engine will benefit movie enthusiasts and the general public in their quest for discovering and exploringÂ movies.
